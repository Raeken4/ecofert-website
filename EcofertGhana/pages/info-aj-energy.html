    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>AJ Clean African Energy is a dynamic startup dedicated to revolutionizing the energy sector through sustainable biogas production. As part of the Ecofert Ghana Limited family, our mission is to provide clean, renewable energy solutions that reduce environmental impact and promote sustainability.</p>
        <p>Our focus is on harnessing the power of organic waste to produce biogas, a versatile and eco-friendly fuel. By converting waste into energy, we aim to address both energy needs and waste management challenges, contributing to a circular economy.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="about-biogas">
        <h2>About Biogas</h2>
        <p>Biogas is a renewable energy source produced through the anaerobic digestion of organic materials such as agricultural waste, food scraps, and sewage. This process occurs in the absence of oxygen, where bacteria break down the organic matter to produce a mixture of gases, primarily methane (CH₄) and carbon dioxide (CO₂).</p>
        <p>Biogas can be used as a fuel for heating, cooking, and generating electricity. It is a clean and environmentally friendly alternative to fossil fuels, significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By utilizing biogas, we can decrease reliance on non-renewable energy sources and mitigate climate change.</p>

    <section id="technology">
        <h2>Technology and Process</h2>
        <p>At AJ Clean African Energy, we employ state-of-the-art anaerobic digestion technology to convert organic waste into biogas. Our process involves several key steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Feedstock Collection:</strong> We collect organic waste from various sources, including agricultural residues, food processing by-products, and municipal waste.</li>
            <li><strong>Anaerobic Digestion:</strong> The collected waste is fed into anaerobic digesters, where bacteria break down the organic matter in the absence of oxygen, producing biogas.</li>
            <li><strong>Gas Purification:</strong> The raw biogas is purified to remove impurities and increase the methane content, enhancing its quality as a fuel.</li>
            <li><strong>Energy Generation:</strong> The purified biogas is used to generate electricity, heat, or as a fuel for vehicles, depending on the application.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Our innovative approach ensures maximum efficiency and minimal environmental impact, making our biogas production process both sustainable and economically viable.</p>

    <section id="benefits">
        <h2>Benefits of Biogas</h2>
        <p>The use of biogas offers numerous benefits, making it an attractive option for sustainable energy production:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Environmental Benefits:</strong> Biogas production reduces greenhouse gas emissions by capturing methane that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere. It also helps manage organic waste, reducing landfill use and associated environmental issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Benefits:</strong> Biogas provides a cost-effective energy solution, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and stabilizing energy prices. It also creates opportunities for job creation and economic growth in the renewable energy sector.</li>
            <li><strong>Energy Independence:</strong> By producing biogas locally, communities and industries can reduce their reliance on imported energy, enhancing energy security and resilience.</li>
            <li><strong>Sustainable Agriculture:</strong> Biogas production from agricultural waste supports sustainable farming practices by providing a valuable use for waste materials and reducing the environmental impact of agriculture.</li>
        </ul>
